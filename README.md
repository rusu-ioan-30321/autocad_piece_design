# LEGO Brick 3D Technical Drawing – AutoCAD

## Project Overview
This project consists of a detailed 2D technical drawing of a classic LEGO brick (4x2 configuration), created in AutoCAD based on real measurements.

## Physical Specifications
- Length: 32 mm
- Width: 16 mm
- Height: 19 mm
- Measurement tool: Electronic caliper (±0.1 mm accuracy)
- Material: ABS plastic

## Measurement Process
Most external dimensions were measured precisely using an electronic caliper.  
The internal cylindrical cavities were approximated due to limited physical access for direct measurement.

Because of the small dimensions of the brick, the drawing was scaled for clarity and better visualization.

## AutoCAD Tools & Commands Used
- LINE
- PLINE
- CIRCLE
- POLYGON
- ARRAY (for precise replication of studs and symmetric elements)
- TRIM
- DIMLINEAR
- DIMRADIUS

## Technical Focus
- Geometric precision
- Parametric spacing between elements
- Symmetry and repetition using ARRAY
- Accurate dimensioning

## What I Learned
- Applying real-world measurements to technical drawings
- Precision modeling in small-scale objects
- Efficient use of ARRAY for repetitive structures
- Professional dimensioning standards
